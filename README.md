Why the name?
-------------

"Parlex" is a combination of shortened forms of "Parser" and "Lexer", which is what the software will do eventually and is a play on the word "Parlance" (synonyms: language, tongue, speech). The "-js" just cues people in to the fact that this is written in Javascript. If all goes well, I plan on doing a version in another language too.

It's fun to play with words.
